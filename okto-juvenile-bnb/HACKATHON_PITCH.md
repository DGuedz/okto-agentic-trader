# PROJECT: OKTO AGENTIC TRADER

## The Problem: Retail Inefficiency
The current DeFi landscape forces traders to choose between opaque, centralized interfaces or slow, manual interaction with DEXs. This latency and lack of privacy expose retail orders to sandwich attacks and front-running.

## The Solution: Sovereign Infrastructure
Okto is not just a bot; it is a self-hosted financial infrastructure. By running locally (Headless), it bypasses web interfaces entirely, interacting directly with smart contracts via RPC and exchange APIs via CCXT.

## Key Innovation: The "Silent" Operator
Inspired by Dark Pools in TradFi, Okto creates a layer of privacy for execution. It does not broadcast intent until the exact moment of execution, protecting the user's alpha.
