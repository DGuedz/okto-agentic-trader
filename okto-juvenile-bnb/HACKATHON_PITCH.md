# OKTO AGENTIC ASSISTANT
**Tracks:** 🤖 AI Agent | 💸 DeFi | 🔗 BNB Chain
**Submission Type:** Autonomous On-Chain Agent

> **"Headless, spec-driven, and auditable. Execute institutional strategies (Dark Pool, Sniping, Arbitrage) directly from your terminal."**

---

## 💡 THE PROBLEM
Retail traders on **BNB Chain** are fighting a losing battle against MEV bots and institutional algorithms. They suffer from:
1.  **Latency:** Manual execution is too slow for volatile crypto markets.
2.  **Front-Running:** Large orders are sandwiched by predatory bots in the public mempool.
3.  **Data Asymmetry:** Retail lacks institutional indicators like Order Book Imbalance (OBI) and VWAP to confirm trends.

## 🐙 THE SOLUTION: OKTO
Okto is a **Headless AI Agent** that bridges the gap between HFT (High-Frequency Trading) and DeFi. It runs locally, protecting your keys, while autonomously executing complex strategies on BNB Chain futures and spot markets.

### 🧠 Core Intelligence (The "Confluence Supreme" Engine)
Okto doesn't guess. It uses a multi-vector decision engine:
1.  **Price Action:** Monitors RSI (<30/>70) and Bollinger Band breakouts.
2.  **Institutional Flow:** Calculates **VWAP** and **Funding Rates** to detect trend exhaustion.
3.  **Volume Delta:** Confirms aggression (Buyers vs Sellers) before pulling the trigger.
4.  **Smart Execution:**
    *   **Dark Pool Logic:** Splits orders into micro-chunks to hide intent.
    *   **Smart Grid:** Places Limit Orders (Maker) exactly at **OBI (Order Book Imbalance)** support walls.

## ⛓️ PROOF OF EXECUTION (ON-CHAIN VERIFICATION)
We don't just write code; we execute.
*   **Network:** BNB Chain (BSC)
*   **Strategy:** Volatility Scalping (Long/Short) via CEX/DEX Bridge.
*   **Live Transaction Hash:** `0x814bb9e54b9302f399ab1865b6cfb9834a38e1ac61e6c855108936325cc94427` (Deposit/Liquidity Proof)
*   **Audit Log:** `proof_of_efficiency/trade_execution_audit.md` (Generated autonomously by the agent).

## 🤖 AI-NATIVE BUILD LOG (VIBE CODING)
This project embodies the **"Good Vibes Only"** spirit. It was built using **AI-Augmented Programming (Trae IDE)**.
*   **Methodology:** The core logic (OBI Analyzer, Scalp Tentacle) was generated through iterative AI pair-programming sessions.
*   **Efficiency:** We went from concept to a live HFT engine in under 48 hours.
*   **Result:** Clean, modular, and heavily commented Python 3.14 code.

---

## 🛠️ TECH STACK & REPRODUCIBILITY
*   **Core:** Python 3.14 (Async Execution)
*   **Data Science:** Pandas/NumPy for real-time statistical analysis.
*   **Connectivity:** CCXT (Bridge) + Web3.py (On-Chain Settlement).
*   **Deployment:** Docker-ready, local execution for maximum security.

**How to Run:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/okto-agent/okto-juvenile-bnb.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
