# Aster code

### 1: What's aster code&#x20;

Aster code is an ecosystem for brokers, providing brokers with a more efficient method to collect builder fees. It integrates a dedicated workflow that enables builders to receive commissions directly when users trade through their custom interfaces. Builders can claim builder fees from the builder center page. Become a Builder to unlock real-time monitoring of your performance data and earnings!

### &#x20;2: How Aster code work

To become a builder and start earning fees, follow these steps:

· Create an Account: Register using your Web3 wallet address.

· Deposit the required default amount : 100 Aster into your Aster perps account. The builder must hold at least 100 Aster in the perps wallet during the whole process.\
\
· Build your own UI and link the UI with Aster code entrance, you can find the API demo code on the below Aster code API instruction.

· Invite users to trade via your UI page. Users will need to complete both Agent approval and Builder fee approval first when they try to trade via the builder's page.\
\
How to check the builder fee details:\
Refer to [Aster code](https://www.asterdex.com/en/aster-code) page then click “builder center” to get the overview builder fee details and claim your builder fee.

### &#x20;3: Why use Aster code?

· Fee Collection: Builders can reliably earn a builder fee for executed trades(ADL and liquidation orders won’t count builder fee).

· Transparent User Consent: Users explicitly approve both the broker (agent) and the maximum builder fee rate.\
\
· Automated Rewards: Once an order is filled and validated, builder fees are recorded automatically per day.

· Integration: The flow fits into existing trading steps—users approve the builder and agent during the “Enable Trading” process.

**Note:**&#x20;

* The secret key is only visible when the API key is first created. After that, it will be masked and cannot be viewed again.
* Be sure to copy and store the secret key securely right after creating it.
* If you lose your secret key, you’ll need to delete the API key and create a new one.
* Do not share your API key or secret key with anyone to avoid potential losses.
* It’s recommended to bind your API key to a fixed IP address to enhance account security.
* You can view and manage your API keys in [API management](https://www.asterdex.com/en/api-management).
* Each account can create up to 30 API keys.
